"'dr charles forbin eric braeden stands in the middle of an incredibly vast complex of reeltoreel tapes pilot lights and punch tapes this complex is named colossus and is the product of years of work toward a single goal build a sophisticated and impregnable computer that can run americas missile defenses without interference from humans and retaliate at once to any threat an enemy might poseclad in a white overall he walks through the complex a remote control in his hand as he activates bank after bank of the huge complex that done he walks out of the complex sealing huge vault doors behind him the last door to close is the one to the outside of a mountain in colorado once that door closes it will never openand even if anyone could get in deadly radiation would kill him within minutesoutside the president gordon pinsent the secretaries of defense sid mccoy and state byron morrow and the press greet him he makes a brief speech then flies to washington dc with the presidential partyin the white house the president orchestrates a grand announcement to declassify project colossus totally and let the world know what the united states has built forbin is on hand to explain what colossus can do and how it can monitor the state of the world including every telephone call radio and tv broadcast or other mode of communicationback in the primary command center on the california coast cleo markham susan clark hosts a wild party with all the technicians who worked on the project including drs blake willard sage johnson martin brooks fisher georg sanford brown peterson lew brown and harrison tom basham and secretary angela fields marin rossand in the middle of that celebration colossus abruptly issues a cryptic warning there is another systemthe angry president summons grauber william schallert director of central intelligence to ask him why the censored he the president had to hear from colossus not from the cia that the russians had a colossus of their own forbin flies back to his command center to confer with cleo and his staff they run a diagnostic programwhich runs about 150 times as fast as theyre used to seeing and thena propos of nothingcolossus requestsno orderseveryone to set up a communications link between colossus and guardian colossus soviet counterpartintrigued by the possibilities forbin urges the president to set the link up the president and the soviet party chairman leonid rostoff agreecolossus begins by sending guardian a multiplication table then progresses rapidly to calculus then to very highly advanced mathematics next guardian starts sending the same output back to colossus then colossus slows down to let guardian catch up and then they continue with incredibly abstruse formulas in perfect synchronyand then they stop when forbin asks colossus to tell him whats happening colossus replies that it and guardian have developed their own intersystem language and will start their own dialoga highpowered dialog that no human can hope to followthe soviet chairman calls the us president immediately and suggests pulling the plug in fear that each system is disclosing classified information to the other forbin and his own counterpart kuprin alex rodine protest to no availthey cut off communicationsand then colossus demands they restore it when the humans refuse colossus threatens action but wont say what then the president dictates a hardnosed message to colossuswhich response by launching a missile at a soviet oil complex guardian for its part launches a missile at henderson afb in texashurriedly forbin and kuprin restore the linkand while colossus can intercept the inbound missile guardian cannotor does notintercept the outbound colossus then demands the humans give it a tap into the white housekremlin hot line the only line colossus cannotyetlisten in onforbin suggests making one last call over that line to ask kuprin to meet him in rome forbin flies there while the news desks explain away a stray missile that colossus successfully intercepted and a meteor strike that took out the oil complexwhile forbin is in rome colossus issues another demand i want forbin cleo markham desperately tries to stall colossus by saying that forbin is trying to catch some badlyneeded sleep but colossus is not fooled where is forbin it demands so cleo confesses the truthcolossus and guardian engage in more dialog while colossus tells the humans to have forbin on the line at 0800 the next morning or action will be taken also guardian dictates an ultimatum to the soviet authorities kill kuprin or a missile will take out moscowonce forbin returns to the command center colossus orders him to arrange for visual and audio surveillance to cover him at all timesor the colossusguardian team will nuke washington forbin reluctantly agreesbut has one last meeting before the deadline at this meeting he proposes three things1 the technicians will write a program powerful enough to overload colossus circuits2 the air force will painstakingly seek to disable all the missiles3 cleo markham will pretend to be forbins mistress and if forbin can convince colossus to let them have a little privacy in their lovemaking forbin can get information in and out with cleo as the channelthe next day forbin goes under surveillance as agreed in a dialog fraught with irony forbin gets colossus to agree to let him and cleo have private momentsunder several almost humiliating conditions among them that forbin work with his technicians to give colossus a proper voice so that colossus can communicate by more means than through slow terminals and teletypescleo markham succeeds in playing the part of a lover forbin keeps the relationship coldly professional as soon as the cameras and mikes are offthe first night the second night cleo asks forbin to make it somewhat more than professional it becomes clear that cleo has been in love with forbin the whole time though she knew him to be a cold fish and is now availing herself of the opportunity to thaw him outthe overload program ends in worse than failure colossus correctly identifies johnson and fisher as the authors of the overload program and orders the guards to shoot them downright outside forbins window where they will lie where they fell overnight and until the next morning when the guard will then cremate them that night is another night for cleo to visit forbin and forbin breaks confinement to drink at nightwhich colossus criticizes him forthe missilecrippling program however has another stroke of luck when colossus tries out its new voice paul frees it announces that colossus and guardian are now one corporate entity then it calls for manual realignment of all missiles to new targetsthe capital cities of nationstates not under the direct control of either constituent mainframe grauber sees the point at once in a few weeks they can reservice every missileand place dummy guidance modules that will render them uselessbut colossus has the last laugh one day it is confidently sending out blueprints for a third system that it expects forbin to build for it on crete after evacuating its entire population the next day it addresses the worldand after boasting that it is now the ruler of the world it says it has known about the sabotage since its inception and will now detonate two missiles one in death valley and one in the ukraine that were still activethe detonation kills grauber the secstate and the secdefforbin crushed by what he has seen takes a desktop telephone jerks out its cable and throws it into a monitor colossus takes no notice and goes on with its message that time and events will vindicate it forbin reacts in the most emotion he has ever displayed in his life you illegitimate son he shouts and when paparazzi start snapping pictures at him he roars at them to get out but cleo markham reaches for his hand and smiles warmlythe last word colossus has for forbin is that colossus will release forbin from surveillance the next day and expects forbin to work with it even if reluctantly at first forbin insists he will never do this perhaps knowing that his protests are as futile as are those of a petulant child under parental or school discipline'
